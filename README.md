# Structured Programming Adventure Game

Create a text-based adventure game in Python. Your game will use a **state machine** to move the player between different rooms or locations. You may choose any theme you want, such as fantasy, science fiction, mystery, school, survival, comedy, or something completely original.

Whenever the player enters a room, the program should provide a brief description of the location and present the actions that are currently available. The player will interact with the game by entering text commands or selecting from a numbered list of choices.

For example:

```text
You enter a dark storage room. A locked cabinet sits against the wall.

What would you like to do?
1. Search the room
2. Return to the hallway
```

As the player completes actions, the game should remember what has happened and change accordingly.

## Project Requirements Checklist

### Game Structure

* [x] Your game uses a **state machine** to keep track of the player's current room or location.
* [ ] Your game contains **at least 10 different rooms or locations**.
* [ ] The rooms are connected in a **non-linear layout**. The player must have choices about where to travel rather than simply moving through rooms in one fixed order.
* [ ] Each room provides a clear description when the player enters it.
* [ ] Each room provides the player with appropriate actions or choices.
* [ ] The player can move between rooms using text input.
* [ ] Your game has a clear objective and a clear ending.
* [ ] The player can successfully complete or win the game.

### Tracking Game Information

* [ ] Your program uses **at least 6 variables** to keep track of information about what has happened in the game.
* [ ] These variables affect what the player can see, do, or access later in the game.

Possible information to track could include:

* Whether a door has been unlocked.
* Whether an enemy has been defeated.
* Whether an item has been collected.
* Whether treasure has already been taken.
* Whether a puzzle has been solved.
* Whether the player has discovered important information.

### Changing Choices

* [ ] The available choices in a room change when appropriate based on what has already happened.
* [ ] Actions that can only happen once are removed or changed after they are completed.

For example, if the player chooses to take a key, the game should remember that the key has been taken. Returning to the room should no longer give the player the option to take the same key again.

### Challenge or Obstacle

* [ ] Your game includes **at least one obstacle that requires the player to provide a specific input before they can continue**.
* [ ] The obstacle must require the player to discover, calculate, remember, or determine the correct answer.
* [ ] Successfully completing the obstacle must affect the state of the game.

Examples could include calculating the answer to a problem given by a character, discovering a password in another room, finding a code that opens a locked door, or collecting information needed to answer a question later.

### User Input and Output

* [ ] The program clearly explains what is happening to the player.
* [ ] The player is given clear instructions about what they can enter.
* [ ] The program **validates all user input before using it**.
* [ ] Invalid input does not cause the program to crash.
* [ ] Invalid input provides useful feedback and allows the player to try again.
* [ ] The game should be **error-proof during normal gameplay**.

### Structured Programming

Your program must demonstrate a clear understanding of the three major control structures used in structured programming:

* [ ] **Sequence:** Instructions are organized in a logical order so that actions happen at the correct time.
* [ ] **Selection:** `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are used to make decisions based on user choices and the current state of the game.
* [ ] **Iteration:** Loops are used appropriately to repeat gameplay and/or validate user input.
* [ ] **Functions:** Functions are used to organize the program into manageable sections and avoid unnecessary repeated code.

## Creativity

The requirements above describe the minimum functionality your game must include. Everything else is up to you.

You are encouraged to create your own setting, characters, story, puzzles, obstacles, items, secrets, and game mechanics. Your game can be serious, funny, strange, challenging, story-focused, or anything else you would enjoy creating, as long as it meets all of the project requirements.
